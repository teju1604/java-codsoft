As a part of my Internship, I've developed 3 tasks which are as follows :

**Task 1: NUMBER GAME**

The first task for this internship was to develop a simple random number guessing game in Java. The game had to generate a random number between 1 and 100, prompt the user to enter their guess, and provide feedback on whether the guess was correct, too high, or too low. The game also had to keep track of the number of guesses the user took and display the user's score at the end of the game.


**Task 2: STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR** 

The second task for this internship was to develop a simple student grade calculator. This calculator has to take input marks obtained(out of 100) as an input in each subject. Sum up the marks. Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the average percentage.


**Task 3: ATM INTERFACE** 

The third task of this internship was to develop a simp atm interface. This interface includes different options such as withdrawal, depositing, and checking the balance. It will validate the user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits. It will also display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transaction.
